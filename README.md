# unifi-freeradius-scripts
Unifi Scripts to use with freeradius to have traffic limitations for the users

# Reasons
Unifi AP does not implement many RADIUS AVPs and I needed to restrict traffic for users in my network. Because Unifi Controller implements a quite well API I've done the implementation through this API.

# Stuff this do...
- This can check if there are devices without unauthorized access in the network
- We also can give a maximum data/day or whatever period you want between hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly and if the user overpass that limit put him in a slower group.
